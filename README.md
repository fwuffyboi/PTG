This project aims to become a personal "smart-device" similar to the likes of a google home(Without the whole stalking your every move and reporting it to a central server where it will never be deleted thing.), 
it will feature:
-- facial recognition
-- device usage logging
-- remote management
-- personal results based on the person using it
-- and MUCH, MUCH more!
